You use the Port Integrations Framework for Python (**Ocean**) to create, configure, and manage Port Integrations, such as Gitlab and Azure Port integrations. 

The SDK provides a set of tools and an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing Port Integrations.

This documentation covers the Framework Internal codebase. For more information about the Port Integrations Framework, see the [Port Integrations Framework](https://ocean.getport.io/) documentation.
