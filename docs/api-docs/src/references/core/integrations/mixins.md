# Mixins

A mixin in Python is a class that adds specific behaviors to other classes without making them inherit from a single parent class. This enables code reuse and modular design by allowing methods and attributes to be shared across different classes.

Mixins are especially valuable when sharing functionality between unrelated classes, avoiding complex class hierarchies and the challenges of multiple inheritance.
