If a resync event is received by your integration while it is actively performing a resync, the currently running resync will be aborted and a new resync process will start.

If a new resync trigger consistently aborts a running resync, it means that your integration never finishes a complete resync process (which means some information from the 3rd-party system might never appear in Port).
