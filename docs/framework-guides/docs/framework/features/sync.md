description: Use Ocean to keep the catalog up to date
---

The Ocean framework provides a way to sync entities state between the 3rd party application and Port. This can be done
by Ocean sync and raw sync functionality.

One of ocean main goal is to provide a simple unified way to sync entities state into Port
while [Resource Mapping](./resource-mapping.md) capabilities introduced in other Port integrations.

:::note
The following functions are checking the difference between a give state and Port entities state and will create/update
or delete only entities that created or updated by the integration. As explained in the [User Agent](./user-agent.md)
page.

- [`ocean.sync_raw_all`](#oceansync_raw_all)
- [`ocean.sync`](#oceansync)

## Ocean Raw Sync

Ocean Raw Sync is a simple way to sync entities state into Port. By leveraging JQ Expression Language, Ocean Raw Sync
allows the integration end user to define the way ocean will transform the 3rd party raw data into Port entities.

By default, Ocean will raw sync all data returned from the `@ocean.on_resync` listener functions. On these functions,
the integration needs to return a list of raw data (dictionaries) that the end user will be able to transform into
Port entities using the [Resource Mapping](./resource-mapping.md).

[Ocean context](./contexts.md#ocean-context) expose multiple functions that can be used to help to sync raw data into
Port.

### `@ocean.on_resync()`

A decorator that will wrap the function that will be called when the integration received a
resync event. The wrapped function will need to return a list of raw data (dictionaries) that will be transformed into
Port entities. The decorator by default will register the function to be called for all kinds specified in the
user [Resource Mapping](./resource-mapping.md), but it can be configured to be called only for specific kinds by
passing the `kind` argument to the decorator (default value is `*`).

:::tip
For a large amount of data that is required to fetch from the 3rd party application, it is recommended to use the
`@ocean.on_resync` decorator and instead of returning the data directly, to return a generator that will yield the
data like specified in
the [Performance](../../develop-an-integration/performance.md#generators-in-the-ocean-framework) page.
:::

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean


@ocean.on_resync("SpecialKind")
def special_kind_resync(kind: str):
    return [...]  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application


@ocean.on_resync()
def generic_resync(kind: str):
    if kind == "SpecialKind":
        return []
    return [...]  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application
```

### `ocean.sync_raw_all`

This function will check the current integration entities state and will call all
the [`@ocean.on_resync()`](#oceanon_resync) wrapped functions with the relevant kind, then it will proceed with
transforming,
checking the difference between Port state and the raw data returned from the wrapped functions and will create/update
or delete the relevant entities.

:::note
This function will start a new `resync` event and will call all the wrapped functions, therefore it is recommended to
use this function only when the integration needs to sync all the entities state.
:::

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean


@ocean.router.post("/my-custom-resync")
def my_custom_resync():
    ocean.sync_raw_all()
```

### `ocean.update_raw_diff`

A function that will calculate the difference between 2 states and apply it to port
accordingly. The function will required 2 arguments, the first one `kind` is the kind of the entities that will be
synced which will be used to identify the relevant [Resource Mapping](./resource-mapping.md) and the second one
is `raw_diff` which is a dictionary that contains 2 keys `before` and `after` that will contain the state of known
entities before and the desired state after the sync. After calculating which entities need to be created, updated
or deleted, the function will apply the changes to Port.

:::note
The `ocean.update_raw_diff` function will not affect entities that are not defined in the given states.
Therefore, if the integration is syncing a list of entities, the function will not delete entities that are not
defined in the before state and missing in the after state.
:::

:::tip
An empty list can be passed to the `before` or `after` keys to indicate that there is no state for the given kind,
and therefore all the entities in the other state will be created or deleted accordingly.
:::

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    # Fetch the raw data from the 3rd party application
    raw_data = [...]  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application

    # Calculate the difference between the current state and the desired state
    ocean.update_raw_diff("MyKind", {
        "before": [...],  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application
        "after": raw_data
    })
```

### `ocean.register_raw`

A function that will only transform the given data into Port entities without calculating the difference between the
the data and port state and just create or update the resulted entities in Port.

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    # Fetch the raw data from the 3rd party application
    raw_data = [...]  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application

    # Register the raw data into Port
    ocean.register_raw("MyKind", raw_data)
```

### `ocean.unregister_raw`

A function that will only transform the given data into Port entities without calculating the difference between the
the data and port state and just delete the resulted entities in Port.

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    # Fetch the raw data from the 3rd party application
    raw_data = [...]  # List of raw dictionaries from the 3rd party application

    # Unregister the raw data from Port
    ocean.unregister_raw("MyKind", raw_data)
```

## Ocean Sync

All the [Ocean Raw Sync](#ocean-raw-sync) functionality is also implemented in a Sync form. While the Raw Sync will
required the integration to register the data as is and later on required the end user to specify how to transform the
data into Port entities, the Sync functionality will receive an already transformed data that will be pass in a form of
an Entity.

### `ocean.update_diff` (equivalent to [`ocean.update_raw_diff`](#oceanupdaterawdiff))

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean
from port_ocean.core.models import Entity


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    entities = [Entity(...)]  # List of constructed entities

    # Calculate the difference between the current state and the desired state
    ocean.update_diff({
        "before": [...],
        "after": entities
    })
```

### `ocean.register` (equivalent to [`ocean.register_raw`](#oceanregisterraw))

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean
from port_ocean.core.models import Entity


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    entities = [Entity(...)]  # List of constructed entities

    # Register the entities into Port
    ocean.register(entities)
```

### `ocean.unregister` (equivalent to [`ocean.unregister_raw`](#oceanunregisterraw))

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean
from port_ocean.core.models import Entity


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    entities = [Entity(...)]  # List of constructed entities

    # Register the entities into Port
    ocean.unregister(entities)
```

### `ocean.sync`

Ocean sync is a function that will receive a list of pre constructed entities and will calculate the difference between
the given list and Port state and will apply the changes to Port.

```python
from port_ocean.context.ocean import ocean
from port_ocean.core.models import Entity


@ocean.router.post("/sync")
def sync_webhook():
    entities = [Entity(...)]  # List of constructed entities

    # Sync the entities into Port
    ocean.sync(entities)
```
