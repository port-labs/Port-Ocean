and will allow you to test it.
Then proceed with triggering the integration as mentioned in
the [Trigger Your Integration](/develop-an-integration/trigger-your-integration) guide.

### What's the process for debugging my integration?

To debug your integration follow the steps in
the [Debugging](/develop-an-integration/update-integration-code#debugpy---debug-an-integration) guide.

### Is it necessary to publish my integration?
